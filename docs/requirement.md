Based on the description in `docs/idea.md`, here are some functional requirements for a desktop app to show a single stock price:

1. The application should be able to fetch real-time data of a specific stock from a stock market API. The data should include at least the current price of the stock.

2. The application should display the current price of the stock on the user interface in real-time. The price should be updated at a regular interval, for example, every second.

4. The application should handle errors gracefully. If the stock symbol entered by the user is not valid or the API fails to return data, the application should display an appropriate error message to the user.

5. The application should have a simple and intuitive user interface. It should be easy for the user to understand how to input a stock symbol and see the current price.
